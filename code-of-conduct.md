All members and participants in the SIRA (Society of Information Risk Analysis) Membership Slack, SIRA Mailing List, SIRAcon, and any other official SIRA event or activity are required to comply with the following Code of Conduct. Administrators (see below for definition of Administrators) will enforce this code throughout SIRA, with support from SIRA's board as necessary. 

# The Short Version

Be respectful of other people; respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered; respect privacy; understand we're not-for-profit; and if you can’t resolve an issue with someone else you should contact the Administrators. If you are being a problem, it will be made clear to you, and you may be asked to leave the Team.

# The Long Version

## Respect

SIRA, and the SIRA Membership Slack is an intentionally positive online community dedicated to developing the practice of risk analysis. We recognize and celebrate the creativity and collaboration of our independent members and the diversity of skills, talents, experiences, cultures, and opinions that they bring to your community. 

SIRA is an inclusive environment, based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender or gender identity (including transgender status), sexual orientation, age, disability, nationality, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political affiliation, or career path.

We value respectful behavior above individual opinions.

Respectful behavior includes but is not limited to:

* Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
* Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
* If you’re not sure, ask someone instead of assuming. No, really. Just ask the Administrators. We’d rather hear from you than hear about something you said or did after the fact, and we are here to help.
* Don’t be a bystander. Role model respectful behaviour, but also help to address disrespect when you see it. 

Disrespectful behavior outside this community may be considered a violation of this code of conduct at the discretion of the Administrators.

## Privacy

This community is not a public space. However, no one has signed a non-disclosure agreement (“NDA”) to participate, and you should not presume anything you say here will remain private, so act accordingly. Protect intellectual property and legally-protected information.

If you want to publicly disclose anything discussed here, use the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule) as the guideline (“participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed”).

For attribution of specific content found on this Slack, we ask that you ask the originator of the content for permission. If you don’t receive consent in a reasonable period of time, we ask that you credit the “SIRA Membership Slack.”

## Not for Profit


While this community is designed to help aspects of risk analysis, and that frequently benefit whatever company or individual a member is currently working for, this is not a place for obvious commercial activities such as recruiting, marketing, or other solicitation, except in channels dedicated to that purpose.

Channels for commercial purposes include:

* #conferences
* #consulting-gigs
* #forsale
* #ibuiltsomething
* #iwrotesomething
* #jobs
* #remote-jobs
* #services

Even channels dedicated to commercial purposes are dedicated to a specific aspect of commercial purpose; it is just as unwelcome to post an unrelated commercial offering there as it is to post in non-commercial channels.

Additionally, some geographically-focused channels have a higher tolerance for specific kinds of commercial activity focused on events based in that region. We recommend the asking protocol below for these channels as well.

Non-obvious commercial activity includes things such as well-intentioned user surveys of a specific channel or responding to a request for tools or services with information about what your company provides.  In these situations, we ask that you:

* Ask permission of the channel *before* posting the solicitation or information
* State clear intent for the purpose
* Listen to the response of your peers

We believe the above protocol is generally useful and should be used when there are any doubts.

If you join this community simply to take value rather than contribute, the community will quickly notice and react. If you are wondering whether a specific action is commercial or not, please ask and calibrate in one of the the channels dedicated to helping people find their way (#coc or #slack-rules).

## Resolve Peacefully

We believe peer-to-peer discussions, feedback, and corrections can help build a stronger, safer, and more welcoming community.

If you see someone violating any part of this Code of Conduct, we urge you to respectfully dissuade them from such behavior. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community respectful, and welcome your input in doing so.

If you experience disrespectful behavior toward yourself or anyone else and feel in any way unable or unwilling to respond or resolve it respectfully (for any reason), please immediately bring it to the attention of an Administrator. We want to hear from you about anything that you feel is disrespectful, threatening, or just something that could make someone feel distressed in any way. We will listen and work to resolve the matter.

## Apologize for Mistakes

Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, or be confronted as such, listen intently, own up to your words and actions, and apologize accordingly. No one is perfect, and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. What matters is how you handle them and that you avoid repeating them in the future.

## Consequences

If you feel a message should be deleted, please refer to our overview of [Deleting Content](https://github.com/societyinforisk/documents-and-resources/blob/master/deleting-content.md).

If you are unable to resolve a situation peacefully, please refer to our [Incident Process](https://github.com/societyinforisk/documents-and-resources/blob/master/incident-process.md) and choose a course of action that suits the situation.

If the Administrators determine that a human is violating any part of this Code of Conduct, the Administrators may take any action they deem appropriate within this Slack team, up to and including expulsion and exclusion from the SIRA Membership Slack.

As Administrators, we will seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for the community. We can’t foresee every situation, and thus if in the Administrator's judgment the best thing to do is to ask a disrespectful individual to leave, we will do so.
